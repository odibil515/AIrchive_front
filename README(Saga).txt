## Why we chose Saga Chainlet

Tradgent is a platform where users can subscribe to AI-powered trading agents that autonomously analyze markets
and execute trades. In this architecture, each agent's decisions are carried out in real time, and scalability and stability
are critical as many users may subscribe and interact with agents simultaneously. We chose Saga's Chainlet infrastructure
because it best meets these architectural demands.
