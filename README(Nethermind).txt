ðŸ§  Nethermind Integration
Tradgent integrates with the Nethermind stack in the following ways:

Modular Agent Architecture with Nethermind Infra: Our backend leverages Nethermindâ€™s execution client and data layer to simulate real-time agent interactions in a modular, 
Ethereum-aligned environment.

AI Agent Observability: Agent behavior is tracked through logs and metrics exposed via Nethermindâ€™s telemetry capabilities, enhancing debugging and analytics workflows.

EVM Compatibility: Tradgent agents operate on EVM-compatible infrastructure powered by Nethermind, ensuring seamless transition from test simulation to live deployment environments.

Planned Integration with Nethermind's Reth and Trace APIs (Upcoming Feature):
We plan to utilize Nethermindâ€™s tracing tools and Reth APIs to enable deeper observability of agent transactions and simulate market behavior under historical conditions. 
This is a future milestone aimed at enhancing backtesting and agent refinement.
