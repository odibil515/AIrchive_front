## ðŸ”— Rootstock Integration

Tradgent is integrated with the Rootstock network in the following ways:

- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Smart contracts were deployed on Rootstock to record agent performance and enable sharing of usage rights in the marketplace.
- **Rootstock Wallet Integration**: Users authenticate and purchase agents using R-BTC through Rootstock wallet integration.
- **Experimental NFTization of Agents**: We experimented with tokenizing agents as NFTs using Rootstockâ€™s NFT token standard, enabling future trading in the marketplace.

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback on Rootstock Development Experience

Here are our key takeaways from developing on Rootstock:

âœ… Low fees and fast transaction speed: These features provided a strong advantage for actual user scenarios and testing AI agents.

âœ… Compatibility with the Web3 ecosystem: Existing tools such as Solidity, MetaMask, Web3.js, and Hardhat worked seamlessly with minimal adjustments.

âœ… Well-structured developer documentation: Rootstockâ€™s official documentation and examples made the initial onboarding process smooth and intuitive.

Conclusion:
Rootstock stands out among Bitcoin Layer 2 blockchains for having one of the lowest entry barriers for Ethereum developers. Its fast transaction throughput
 and low gas fees made it an ideal environment to develop and test trading agents efficiently.
